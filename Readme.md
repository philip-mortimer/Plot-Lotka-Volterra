# Lotka-Volterra Program

This program creates and runs the Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model, and 
displays the results on 2 sub-plots in a single window. Each of the sub-plots
is a line plot.

The first sub-plot shows changes in predator and prey population densities
over time.

The second sub-plot is a phase-space plot which shows predator population 
densities against prey population densities.

The parameters for the model (e.g. the prey growth rate) and other settings 
for the program are specified by the contants near the top of the file
**main.py**.

## How to run the program

Run the file **main.py**.

Note that the **matplotlib** python library must be installed.
